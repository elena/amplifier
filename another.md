# Test

This is from here: [https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

It's very easy to make some words **bold** and other words *italic* with Markdown. You can even [link to Google!](http://google.com)

Quote:

As Kanye West said:

> We're living the future so \\
> the present is our past.



*This text will be italic* \\
**This text will be bold**

Inline `code`, such as `greg==funny`.
