# The design, simulation and characterisation of a class-B audio power amplifier

## Abstract

In this report I describe the design, simulation and characterisation of a novel, high performance,
medium power (&asymp; 50 W) class-B audio amplifier. Following a general discussion of amplifier characteristics
and design goals, the amplifier schematic is presented and described in detail. SPICE simulation results verify the design and provide further understanding of circuit behaviour. A brief discussion on the methodologies of good PCB design is followed by
a presentation of the key experimental characteristics of the amplifier along with a comparison to the characteristics
derived by simulation. An amplifier control board which responds to thermal and short-circuit faults and adds radio and alarm
clock features is briefly discussed. The final chapter `recommendations for future work' is a reflection upon the
strengths and weaknesses of the amplifier design and suggest possible means of improvement.
